            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>I have experience in a wide variety of industries.  From truck driving to automotive sales, I have learned a variety of skills that will help me establish a career in software development.</p>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>As having worked for companies with head counts of over 5,000 as well as companies with only four people, I understand that one thing must always exist: open and effective communication.  I pride myself in being able to communicate necessary and relevant information to those who need it.</p>
            <h4>A Thirst For Knowledge</h4>
            <p>I am not the type of person to stagnate.  I thrive on my thirst for knowledge and learning new concepts and ideas.  Problems exist only to be solved and there is no greater feeling than when I solve a problem that I have encountered.</p>
            <h4>Creativity</h4>
            <p>I have always been a creative person, and that creativity manifests itself in a unique way when I am trying to solve a problem: I'm always trying to think outside of the box and experiment.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
            <p>My greatest passion is <strong>learning new things.</strong> That said, most of my hobbies and interests are simply subjects that I want to learn more about.</p>
            <h4>Blockchain Technology</h4>
            <p>One of the most fascinating topics for me is the idea of decentralized data storage using a blockchain digital ledger to maintain an open, transparent, and secure way of validating data.</p>
            <h4>Welcome to the Machine</h4>
            <p>I love web development, but I'd also like to take a deep dive further into the lower levels of abstraction and meddle with assembler or at least something closer to the hardware.</p>
            <h4>Music!</h4>
            <p>As a musician and songwriter, I love just about everything music-related.  I enjoy reading about production and recording techniques and I especially love learning about sound synthesis.</p>
