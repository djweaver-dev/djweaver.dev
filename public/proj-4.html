            <p>
                LeetCode is a platform that suggests user-created coding problems that you can solve.  Some can be a lot of fun.  Some can be really frustrating.  I enjoy looking over my past solutions and seeing if I can improve them.
                
                I also have various algorithms I've tooled around with from different tutorials/documentation.
