            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is a simple blockchain model using an extremely basic hashing algorithm (if you could even call it an algorithm).  When instantiated, a genesis block is created and each subsequent block is linked to the last, creating a chain.</p>
            <h3>Improvements and Ideas</h3>
            <p>
                I want to experiment with persistent data storage using this kind of model and doing typical CRUD operations on that data.
